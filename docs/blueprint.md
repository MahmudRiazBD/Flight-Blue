## Style Guidelines:

- Bright Blue (#007BFF) for a sense of trust and energy.
- Pure White (#FFFFFF), to ensure content readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Sky Blue (#00C4FF) for highlighting important elements and calls to action, providing contrast against the primary blue and white.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif suitable for headlines or small amounts of text; if longer text is anticipated, use 'PT Sans' for body. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a consistent set of icons from Font Awesome or similar library to represent travel, destinations, and actions, keeping the style modern and universally understandable.
- Implement a grid-based layout with TailwindCSS to ensure responsiveness and a consistent look across all devices, using spacing and sizing utilities to create a visually appealing structure.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations for a smooth user experience, using Tailwind's transition and animation classes to avoid heavy JavaScript dependencies.
